# Development Gotchas & Pitfalls

This document tracks non-obvious behaviors, common pitfalls, and architectural "gotchas" in the opnDossier codebase to assist future maintainers and contributors.

## 1. Testing & Concurrency

### 1.1 `t.Parallel()` and Global State

The `cmd/` package uses package-level global variables for CLI flags (required by `spf13/cobra` for flag binding). **Never use `t.Parallel()` in any test that modifies or relies on these global variables.**

- **Problem:** Concurrent tests modifying `sharedDeviceType`, `sharedAuditMode`, or the `rootCmd` flag set will cause non-deterministic data races.
- **Symptom:** `just test-race` fails with "DATA RACE" reports in the `cmd` package.
- **Solution:** Remove `t.Parallel()` from the parent test and all subtests that interact with global flags. Use `t.Cleanup()` to restore original global values after the test.
- **Enforcement:** The `.golangci.yml` `forbidigo` rule forbids `t.Parallel()` anywhere in `cmd/` — catches the regression at lint time. The race detector itself runs only locally via `just test-race` (or `just ci-check`); CI cannot host it reliably, and a prior pre-push `just ci-check` hook broke non-interactive push clients. See [CONTRIBUTING.md § Git Hooks](CONTRIBUTING.md#git-hooks) for the current setup.

### 1.2 Race Detector Collateral

When a data race occurs in a test touching global state, the Go race detector may report collateral races in unrelated, stateless functions (e.g., `truncateString` or `escapePipeForMarkdown`) that happen to be running in other parallel tests.

- **Rule of Thumb:** If a stateless utility function is reporting a race, check if a concurrent test is modifying a global variable.

### 1.3 `require.*` Inside Goroutine Bodies Fails `testifylint go-require`

`require.NoError` / `require.NotNil` and other `require.*` calls invoke `t.FailNow`, which is only valid on the test's main goroutine. The `testifylint` linter (`go-require` rule) flags any `require.*` inside a goroutine body — `golangci-lint run` will fail at commit time even when the test passes at runtime.

- **Pattern:** collect per-goroutine outcomes into shared slices, then assert with `require.*` from the main test goroutine after `wg.Wait()`.
- **Canonical example:** `TestCoreProcessor_Process_ResultIsolation` in `internal/processor/processor_test.go` — `processErrs` and `reports` slices are populated inside goroutines, asserted in a separate post-`wg.Wait()` loop.
- **`assert.*` is fine inside goroutines** — it doesn't call `FailNow`. Use `assert` for soft checks during the goroutine, `require` for halt-the-test checks after the join.

### 1.4 `goconst` Trips on Fixture-Derived String Duplication

The `goconst` linter flags string literals appearing 3+ times in the same package. Tests that hand-write a hostname or other fixture-derived string already present in `generateSmallConfig`/`generateLargeConfig` add a fourth occurrence and fail lint.

- **Wrong:** `expected := "small-config"` in a new test.
- **Right:** `expected := smallConfig.System.Hostname` — sources from the fixture and stays in sync if the fixture changes.
- **Avoid extracting a package-level constant** unless you're going to refactor the fixture builders to use it too — partial extraction keeps the lint warning and adds drift surface.

### 1.5 `gocognit` Threshold Is 40, Not the Default

The `.golangci.yml` `gocognit` linter is configured to fail at cognitive complexity > 40 (the default is 30). Table-driven benchmark functions that fan out 4+ sub-benchmarks via `b.Run` routinely trip it — `BenchmarkMultiFormatExport` (NATS-37) was the canonical case.

- **Fix pattern:** extract per-variant closures into helper functions returning `func(*testing.B)` (e.g., `runMultiFormatGenerate(ctx, gen, device, formats, preEnrich) func(*testing.B)`). Each helper drops the cognitive count of the enclosing function below the threshold without changing the test surface.
- **Don't:** add `//nolint:gocognit` to mask it. The threshold catches a real readability drift; helper extraction fixes both the lint and the readability.
- **Recurrence vector:** any test/benchmark orchestration function that grows from 2 to 4+ dispatch arms inside a `for _, tc := range cases` loop.

## 2. Plugin Architecture

### 2.1 Registry Independence

`audit.PluginManager` maintains its own internal `PluginRegistry` instance. This is **independent** of the global singleton returned by `audit.GetGlobalRegistry()`.

- **Gotcha:** Calling `pm.InitializePlugins()` does **not** populate the global registry.
- **Requirement:** If a plugin must be available globally (e.g., for simple CLI helpers), it must be explicitly registered via `audit.RegisterGlobalPlugin()`.

### 2.2 Panic Recovery Retains Plugins

`RunComplianceChecks` wraps each plugin's `RunChecks()` in `defer recover()`. On panic, a dedicated recovery path populates `PluginFindings`, `PluginInfo`, and `Compliance` with safe defaults, then uses `continue` to skip further method calls on the potentially corrupt plugin.

- **Gotcha:** The recovery path must NOT call methods on the panicked plugin (`Name()`, `Version()`, `Description()`, `GetControls()`) — the plugin's internal state may be corrupt after the panic. Instead, it uses the `pluginName` string already in scope and sets `Version: "unknown (panicked)"` with an empty compliance map.
- **Invariant:** Every selected plugin must appear in all result maps, even if it panicked.

### 2.3 SetPluginDir Must Precede InitializePlugins

`PluginManager.SetPluginDir(dir, explicit)` configures the directory for dynamic `.so` loading. It must be called **before** `InitializePlugins(ctx)` because `InitializePlugins` reads `pm.pluginDir` only during its execution. Calling `SetPluginDir` after `InitializePlugins` mutates the field but has no observable effect on plugin loading because `InitializePlugins` has already completed.

### 2.4 Info Severity Does Not Bypass Compliance

Reclassified info-severity controls (e.g., FIREWALL-003 "Message of the Day") participate in the compliance map normally — they can PASS or FAIL. Severity only affects presentation priority (summary counts, sort order), NOT compliance status. The compliance flip in `RunComplianceChecks` is never skipped based on severity.

- **Gotcha:** A finding with `Severity == "info"` that references a control still flips that control to non-compliant. This is intentional — severity is triage priority, not compliance gating.
- **Gotcha:** Inventory controls (`Type: "inventory"`) are excluded from `EvaluatedControlIDs` entirely and do not appear in the compliance map. They only appear in "Configuration Notes."
- **Gotcha:** `countSeverities` tracks unrecognized severity strings in a private `unknown` counter. Callers with loggers should warn when `counts.unknown > 0`.

### 2.5 Dynamic Plugin Trust Model

`PluginRegistry.LoadDynamicPlugins` uses `plugin.Open()` to load `.so` files from a directory. Loaded plugins execute with full process privileges — there is no signature verification, checksum validation, or sandboxing.

- **Gotcha:** Any `.so` file in the plugin directory will be loaded and executed. A malicious or compromised plugin has the same access as the opnDossier process itself.
- **Mitigation:** Loading is opt-in: it requires an explicit `--plugin-dir` flag (or the equivalent config key). There is no `./plugins` auto-discovery fallback — `PluginManager.InitializePlugins` only calls `LoadDynamicPlugins` when `pluginDir != ""`. Plugins are never fetched remotely.
- **Prevention:** Restrict filesystem permissions on the plugin directory. Only load plugins built from reviewed source code. In shared or CI environments, avoid pointing `--plugin-dir` at world-writable directories.

**Phase A hardening (v1.5).** Before `plugin.Open` is invoked, `runPluginPreflight` in `internal/audit/plugin_preflight.go` rejects the following footguns and emits a structured audit log per attempt:

- **Symlinks rejected** via `os.Lstat` + `os.ModeSymlink` check. `plugin.Open` follows links, so an attacker with write access to the plugin directory could otherwise point a `.so` at anything on the filesystem.
- **Non-regular files rejected** via `info.Mode().IsRegular()` (cross-platform). A FIFO, socket, or device node named `*.so` would otherwise block `hashFileSizeCapped` indefinitely on `os.Open` or `io.CopyN` before `plugin.Open` is ever reached — a DoS primitive trivially reachable on POSIX.
- **Group/world-writable plugin files rejected** when `info.Mode().Perm()&0o022 != 0` (POSIX only). Closes CWE-732 where another local account could swap the file between audits.
- **Group/world-writable container directory rejected** via a second `os.Stat` on `filepath.Dir(path)` (POSIX only). The file bits alone are not enough — a writable parent lets an attacker unlink and replace the plugin.
- **Absolute plugin file paths required at preflight** via `filepath.IsAbs` (cross-platform, defense-in-depth). Relative `--plugin-dir` inputs from the operator are accepted and normalized via `filepath.Abs` before the preflight runs, so `--plugin-dir ./plugins` is a supported invocation; the absolute-path check then fires if any caller ever bypasses `LoadDynamicPlugins` and hands a relative path directly to `runPluginPreflight`.
- **Structured audit log per load attempt**: INFO for accepted loads, WARN for rejections, with fields `plugin`, `path`, `sha256`, `mode`, `owner_uid`, `mtime`, `size_bytes`, `verdict`, `reason`. The logged `path` is the normalized absolute plugin artifact path, and the SHA-256 is computed with a 64 MiB read cap so a pathological `.so` bounds preflight I/O and CPU time (the hasher streams rather than buffers, so this is a time/throughput cap, not a memory-allocation cap).

Rejections are reported as `PluginLoadError` entries in the returned `LoadResult`, so callers see identical wiring for preflight and `plugin.Open` failures.

**Phase B follow-ups (post-v1.5, tracked in todo #146):** owner-UID check (refuse `.so` whose UID does not match the process UID or a configured allowlist), hard configurable size cap (`--plugin-max-size-mb`), path denylist (`/tmp`, `/var/tmp`, `/dev/shm`, `$HOME` when EUID==0), filename allowlist (no NUL / shell metachars / path separators), optional `plugins.sha256` manifest enforcement, documented seccomp/landlock sandboxing recipe, and — aspirationally — out-of-process plugin isolation à la HashiCorp go-plugin.

**Windows behaviour.** POSIX permission bits are meaningless on NTFS, so the writable-mode and writable-dir rejections are skipped at runtime when `runtime.GOOS == "windows"`. The symlink and absolute-path checks still run. The `owner_uid` audit field is emitted as `unavailable` on Windows; Phase B will introduce a SID-aware ownership check if needed.

**See also:** [docs/solutions/runtime-errors/plugin-panic-recovery-audit-runchecks.md](docs/solutions/runtime-errors/plugin-panic-recovery-audit-runchecks.md) — fault-isolation pattern that contains panics from the untrusted plugins described here.

## 3. Data Processing

### 3.1 Map Iteration Order

Go map iteration is non-deterministic.

- **Gotcha:** Any CLI output or file export derived from a map (e.g., `report.Compliance`, `report.Metadata`) must be sorted before rendering.
- **Solution:** Use `slices.Sorted(maps.Keys(m))` or `slices.SortFunc()` to ensure deterministic, testable output.

### 3.2 XML Presence vs. Absence

The `encoding/xml` package treats self-closing tags (e.g., `<disabled/>`) and missing tags identically for `string` fields.

- **Gotcha:** Use `*string` (pointer to string) when you need to distinguish between "element present but empty" (`""`) and "element absent" (`nil`).

### 3.3 Repeated XML Elements and `string` Fields

When an XML element appears multiple times (e.g., `<priv>a</priv><priv>b</priv>`), a `string` field only captures the last occurrence — all others are silently dropped. Use `[]string` for elements that can repeat.

- **Symptom:** Only the last value is retained; no error is raised.
- **Detection:** Compare parsed struct against raw XML — earlier occurrences are silently overwritten by later ones.
- **Fix:** Change the field type from `string` to `[]string` with the same `xml` tag.

## 4. Diff Engine

### 4.1 Section-Level Added/Removed Guards

Most `Compare*` methods in `internal/diff/analyzer.go` have early-return guards that emit a single `ChangeAdded` or `ChangeRemoved` when one side has data and the other does not. For pointer types (`*common.System`), this uses nil checks. For value types (`NATConfig`, slices), this uses `HasData()` or `len() == 0`. New `Compare*` methods must follow this pattern.

- **Exceptions:** `CompareFirewallRules` and `CompareUsers` intentionally omit section-level guards because per-item granularity is more useful for security-sensitive resources (individual rule additions/removals are reported separately).

## 5. CLI Flag Wiring

### 5.1 Silent Flag Ignores

A CLI flag can be accepted by Cobra, stored in a package-level variable, and silently ignored if the command handler never transfers it to `Options` or stores it in an untyped map no consumer reads.

- **Symptom:** Flag accepted without error but output identical with/without it.
- **Detection:** A new flag that breaks zero golden files or tests is likely broken.
- **Prevention:** Typed `Options` fields (not `CustomFields`), regression tests per command, diff output with/without flag.
- **Reference:** `docs/solutions/logic-errors/cli-flag-wiring-silent-ignore.md`

### 5.2 Enum Type Casts from XML

When converting XML schema `string` fields to typed enums (e.g., `common.FirewallRuleType(rule.Type)`), always validate with `IsValid()` after the cast and emit a conversion warning for unrecognized values via `c.addWarning()`. The `DeviceType` enum with `ParseDeviceType()` + `IsValid()` is the canonical pattern. Bare casts silently pass invalid values through the entire pipeline.

- **Symptom:** Invalid enum values (e.g., `FirewallRuleType("match")`) pass through the pipeline without error, failing silently in downstream `switch` statements.
- **Prevention:** Call `IsValid()` after every XML-to-enum cast. For `NATOutboundMode`, `LAGGProtocol`, and `VIPMode` there is no downstream validation — the converter cast is the only defense.
- **Regression tests:** `TestConverter_EnumCast_EmitsWarning` in `pkg/parser/opnsense/converter_enum_cast_test.go` and `pkg/parser/pfsense/converter_enum_cast_test.go` cover every known callsite. When adding a new enum cast, add a row to the table-driven test in the same PR — otherwise the §5.2 defense is invisible.
- **History:** The NATS-145 audit (2026-04-18) discovered two unguarded `IPProtocol` casts in OPNsense `convertOutboundNATRules` and `convertInboundNATRules` that had been silently passing invalid values through for months. Both were fixed in the same audit with the canonical `if field != "" && !cast.IsValid() { addWarning }` pattern.

**See also:** [docs/solutions/logic-errors/opnsense-nat-ipprotocol-enum-cast-missing-guard.md](docs/solutions/logic-errors/opnsense-nat-ipprotocol-enum-cast-missing-guard.md) — full postmortem of the NATS-145 bare-cast audit, including regression-test patterns for new enum callsites.

### 5.3 PreRunE Test Commands Must Bind to Real Globals

When testing `PreRunE` with a temporary `cobra.Command`, bind its flags to the **same** package-level variables the real command uses (e.g., `tempCmd.Flags().StringVar(&auditMode, ...)`). If you bind to local variables instead, `PreRunE` reads stale globals and tests pass vacuously. Always set values via `cmd.Flags().Set()` (not direct assignment) to exercise real pflag parsing.

## 6. Validator

### 6.1 GID/UID Zero is Valid

Unix GID 0 (wheel/root group) and UID 0 (root user) are valid. The validator check is `gid < 0` / `uid < 0`, correctly allowing zero. Error messages must say "non-negative integer", not "positive integer".

**See also:** [docs/solutions/architecture-issues/file-split-refactor-gotchas.md](docs/solutions/architecture-issues/file-split-refactor-gotchas.md) — the validator file-split refactor where this "non-negative integer" fix was applied alongside pre-existing helper issues.

## 7. Parser Registry

### 7.1 Blank Import Requirement

`pkg/parser/factory.go` dispatches through the registry, not via direct imports. The OPNsense parser only registers itself when its package `init()` runs, which requires a blank import: `_ "github.com/EvilBit-Labs/opnDossier/pkg/parser/opnsense"`.

- **Symptom:** `"unsupported device type: root element <opnsense> is not recognized; supported: (none registered -- ensure parser packages are imported)"` -- empty registry with hint
- **Cause:** Missing blank import means `init()` never ran, registry is empty
- **Fix:** Add the blank import to the test file or production file using `parser.NewFactory()`
- **Detection:** Any new test file using `parser.NewFactory()` that sees an empty registry is missing the blank import

**See also:** [docs/solutions/architecture-issues/pluggable-deviceparser-registry-pattern.md](docs/solutions/architecture-issues/pluggable-deviceparser-registry-pattern.md) — the registry pattern whose init-time self-registration is what the blank import activates.

## 8. Audit Command

### 8.1 Mode/Plugin Coupling

Only `blue` mode runs `RunComplianceChecks`. Red mode ignores `SelectedPlugins` entirely. The `--plugins` flag is rejected in `PreRunE` unless `--mode blue` is set.

- **Gotcha:** Adding plugin support to red mode requires wiring `RunComplianceChecks` into `generateRedReport` in `mode_controller.go` AND removing the `--plugins`+non-blue-mode rejection guard in `cmd/audit.go` `PreRunE`.
- **Gotcha:** `--plugins` accepts any name at the CLI level — validation is deferred to `ValidateModeConfig` post-init, which checks against the live `PluginRegistry`. Dynamic plugins loaded via `--plugin-dir` are included automatically when `--plugins` is omitted (the "all available" default).

**See also:** [docs/solutions/logic-errors/cli-prerun-validation-timing-dynamic-plugins.md](docs/solutions/logic-errors/cli-prerun-validation-timing-dynamic-plugins.md) — why plugin-name validation moved from `PreRunE` to post-init and how dynamic `.so` plugins now pass the CLI parse gate.

### 8.2 Concurrent Generation, Serial Emission

`runAudit` in `cmd/audit.go` processes files concurrently via `generateAuditOutput` (returns string, no I/O), then writes results serially via `emitAuditResult` in the parent goroutine.

- **Gotcha:** Never add stdout writes or file exports inside `generateAuditOutput` — all emission must go through `emitAuditResult` to prevent interleaved output.
- **Gotcha:** `--output` is rejected with multiple input files in `PreRunE` to prevent file clobbering.

### 8.3 Multi-File Output Path Uniqueness

`deriveAuditOutputPath` uses lossless tilde-based escaping: tildes in path segments become `~~` and underscores become `~u`, freeing the literal underscore to serve as an unambiguous directory separator. This prevents distinct paths from collapsing to the same filename, including boundary cases where one segment ends with `_` and the next begins with `_` (e.g., `a_/b/config.xml` → `a~u_b_config-audit.md` versus `a/_b/config.xml` → `a_~ub_config-audit.md`).

- **Gotcha:** Simple character replacement (e.g., `/` → `-`) is NOT sufficient — paths like `a-b/c/config.xml` and `a/b-c/config.xml` would collide. The escaping must be lossless (invertible). The earlier double-underscore scheme (`_` → `__`, separator → `_`) was also insufficient — it collapsed at segment boundaries where trailing/leading underscores were indistinguishable from the separator.
- **Gotcha:** Expected output filenames are asserted in 5+ test functions (`TestDeriveAuditOutputPath`, `TestEmitAuditResult_MultiFileAutoNaming`, `TestEmitAuditResult_MultiFileConfigOutputFileIgnored`, `TestDeriveAuditOutputPath_BasenameCollision`, `TestDeriveAuditOutputPath_BoundaryUnderscoreCollision`, etc.). When changing the encoding scheme, grep for all assertion sites — missing one causes CI failure.

### 8.4 Red Mode Analysis (formerly Stub Implementations)

`generateRedReport` in `mode_controller.go` runs `analysis.ScanObservations` once, then its five analysis methods — `addWANExposedServices`, `addWeakNATRules`, `addAdminPortals`, `addAttackSurfaces`, `addEnumerationData` (implemented in `internal/audit/red_analysis.go`) — perform real, reachability-filtered analysis of the `CommonDevice`. The former placeholder-stub behavior and the `cmd/audit.go` `PreRunE` "experimental / not yet implemented" warning were removed in the red-lens slice (epic #281, slice 2).

- **Findings vs. metadata split:** Only three of the five methods append to `report.Findings`. `addWANExposedServices` (the primary producer: one Finding + `AttackSurface` per WAN-reachable WebGUI/SSH/SNMP service), `addWeakNATRules` (WAN-reachable inbound NAT port-forwards), and `addAttackSurfaces` (WAN-reachable shared-engine hygiene observations reframed as exposure, de-duped by `Component`). `addAdminPortals` and `addEnumerationData` emit **structured metadata only** (portal inventory tagged by reachability; recon counts) — deliberately NOT Findings, to avoid double-counting an exposure already surfaced by a Finding-producing method. Every WAN exposure still lands in Findings, but via the method that owns that exposure class: firewall-local management-service exposure (WebGUI/SSH/SNMP) via `addWANExposedServices`, and inbound NAT port-forward exposure independently via `addWeakNATRules`. The metadata-only methods never introduce an exposure that one of those two does not already surface as a Finding.
- **WAN-exposed = correlation, not enabled-alone:** a firewall-local management service (WebGUI/SSH/SNMP) is WAN-reachable only when enabled AND a WAN-reachable firewall pass rule permits its port (`wanRulePermitsPort` / `rulePortPermits`). Port matching biases to over-report (empty/`any`/ranges/lists match by containment; an unresolvable port *alias* is treated as permitting — never under-report a possible exposure).
- **NAT rules never correlate against firewall-local services:** `wanRulePermitsPort` (used only by `serviceReachability` for WebGUI/SSH/SNMP) deliberately does NOT consult `device.NAT.InboundRules`. An inbound NAT rule forwards WAN traffic to `InboundNATRule.InternalIP` — a different host than the firewall itself — so a NAT rule sharing an external port with a management service is never evidence that the firewall's OWN service is exposed. An earlier version correlated NAT rules here too, producing a false positive: a NAT rule forwarding WAN port 22 to an unrelated internal host's SSH would flag the firewall's own SSH daemon (also on port 22) as WAN-exposed even with no pass rule ever targeting the firewall directly. NAT-forward exposure is reported separately and correctly by `addWeakNATRules`. See `TestRedMode_NATForward_DoesNotExposeFirewallLocalService`.
- **Web GUI port comes from the unified model, not a hardcode:** `common.WebGUI.Port` carries the configured web-configurator port. Both the OPNsense and pfSense parsers populate it from `<system><webgui><port>` when the element is present in `config.xml`; the 443/80 protocol default applies only when the configured port is absent (either vendor). Red analysis reads `device.System.WebGUI.Port` via `parsePort` rather than assuming 443/80, so a box on a custom GUI port is analyzed correctly regardless of vendor. New device parsers should populate this field when the platform exposes a GUI port.
- **ExploitNotes safety:** red `ExploitNotes` carry impact/context only (never weaponized/step-by-step guidance). Enforced by `FindInstructionalContent` (`exploit_notes_safety.go`) run over the actual generated notes plus a golden-file gate — not authoring discipline. `--audit-blackhat` selects the sharper-tone variant (red mode only; rejected in `PreRunE` for blue mode) and adjusts tone only — the denylist safety invariant holds for both tone variants.
- **NAT correlation is an intentional over-report:** an inbound NAT rule is treated as WAN-reachable when any enabled WAN pass rule exists (not one correlated by port to that specific forward). This is a deliberate safe-direction choice — precise per-rule correlation would risk under-reporting a real exposure, the wrong failure mode for a security audit.

## 9. Dupl Linter Bidirectional Firing

### 9.1 Cross-Type Validator Duplication

When adding device-specific validators that are structurally similar to existing validators (e.g., `validatePfSenseSystem` vs `validateSystem`), the `dupl` linter fires on BOTH files — not just the new one.

- **Gotcha:** Adding `//nolint:dupl` only to the new function is insufficient. The existing function also needs `//nolint:dupl` because `dupl` reports pairs.
- **Pattern:** Both sides of the duplicate pair must carry the suppression directive.

### 9.2 Validator Cascade on Document Field Type Forks

When changing a `Document` field type from an opnsense type to a local pfSense fork (e.g., `opnsense.Dhcpd` → `pfsense.Dhcpd`), the pfSense-specific validator function that accepts a pointer to that type will fail to compile. The shared field-level validator (e.g., `validateDhcpdInterface`) still expects `opnsense.DhcpdInterface`, so the pfSense wrapper must construct a temporary adapter value.

- **Symptom:** `cannot use &doc.Dhcpd (value of type *pfsense.Dhcpd) as *opnsense.Dhcpd`
- **Fix:** Update the pfSense validator signature to accept `*pfsense.Dhcpd` and adapt each item to `opnsense.DhcpdInterface` inside the loop before calling the shared validator.
- **Also update:** Test files (`pfsense_test.go`, `parser_test.go`) that construct `opnsense.Dhcpd{Items: map[string]opnsense.DhcpdInterface{...}}` — change to `pfsense.Dhcpd`/`pfsense.DhcpdInterface`.

## 10. Converter Testing

### 10.1 ToMarkdown Outputs ANSI-Rendered Text

`MarkdownConverter.ToMarkdown()` passes output through `glamour.Render()`, which inserts ANSI escape codes. Tests asserting on the output must set `t.Setenv("TERM", "dumb")` for clean text. Since `t.Setenv` is incompatible with `t.Parallel()`, remove `t.Parallel()` and add `//nolint:tparallel` to the function.

- **Symptom:** `assert.Contains(t, md, "System Configuration")` fails despite the text being present.
- **Fix:** Add `t.Setenv("TERM", "dumb")` at the start of the test (no `t.Parallel()`).
- **Precedent:** `internal/converter/markdown_test.go` uses this pattern throughout.

### 10.2 builder_test.go Uses Raw testing Package

`internal/converter/builder/builder_test.go` does not import `testify/assert`. Use `strings.Contains` + `t.Errorf` for assertions, not `assert.Contains`.

- **Symptom:** `undefined: assert` compilation error in builder tests.
- **Detection:** Check imports at top of test file before adding new test functions.

### 10.3 NAT Rule Field Name Disambiguation

`OutboundNATRule.Target` is the NAT target address. `InboundNATRule.InternalIP` is the port-forward destination — there is no `Target` field on `InboundNATRule`. `FirewallRule` has no `Tag`/`Tagged` fields — those exist only on `OutboundNATRule`.

## 11. Sanitizer

### 11.1 pfSense `bcrypt-hash` Field Name

pfSense stores user passwords in `<bcrypt-hash>` elements, not `<password>` or `<passwd>` like OPNsense. The sanitizer's field-pattern matching must explicitly include `bcrypt-hash` and `sha512-hash` — the generic `"pass"` substring match does not cover these.

- **Symptom:** `sanitize` command outputs bcrypt hashes in cleartext.
- **Fix:** Add `"bcrypt-hash"`, `"sha512-hash"` to the `password` rule's `FieldPatterns` in `internal/sanitizer/rules.go` and to `passwordKeywords` in `internal/sanitizer/patterns.go`.
- **Precedent:** The SNMP community string (`rocommunity`) required a dedicated field pattern for the same reason.

### 11.2 New Device Type Field Names

When adding a new device type (e.g., pfSense), audit the XML element names for credential fields that differ from OPNsense. The sanitizer operates on raw XML element names, not CommonDevice field names. Any device-specific naming for secrets must be added to the sanitizer's pattern lists.

- **Detection:** `sanitize <config.xml> | grep -i 'hash\|secret\|key\|pass'` — check for unredacted sensitive values.
- **Prevention:** When adding a new device schema, grep for credential-like fields and verify each is matched by a sanitizer rule.

### 11.3 OpenVPN TLS and StaticKeys Are Credentials, Not Labels

OpenVPN's `<tls>` element (under `<openvpn-server>` / `<openvpn-client>`) holds the `--tls-auth` / `--tls-crypt` HMAC key, and the MVC `<OpenVPN><StaticKeys>` element holds static-key material. Both arrive in a PEM-shaped envelope with the literal label `-----BEGIN OpenVPN Static key V1-----` — which the stock `IsPrivateKey` detector misses because the label is not `PRIVATE KEY`. The sanitizer's `private_key` rule uses path-anchored `FieldPatterns` (`openvpn.tls`, `openvpn-server.tls`, `openvpn-client.tls`, `openvpn.statickeys`, `statickeys`, `tls_crypt`, `tls_auth`) plus the `IsOpenVPNStaticKey` envelope detector to catch both the field-name and value-based paths.

- **Gotcha:** The substring `tls` ALONE is not safe as a pattern. It would false-positive on:

  - The Suricata IDS wrapper `opnsense.OPNsense.IDS.general.eveLog.tls.*` (a struct of enable/extended/sessionResumption/custom booleans — `pkg/schema/opnsense/security.go` L383).
  - The IPsec strongSwan daemon log-level enum `opnsense.OPNsense.IPsec.charon.syslog.daemon.tls` (an integer 0–5 — `pkg/schema/opnsense/security.go` L443).

  Always anchor OpenVPN TLS patterns to their parent element path (e.g., `openvpn-server.tls`) and verify new unambiguous OpenVPN field names (like `tls_crypt` / `tls_auth`) never collide with other device schemas before adding them bare.

- **Detection:** `TestSanitizeXML_OpenVPNStaticKey` + `TestSanitizeXML_OpenVPN_TLS_NoFalsePositives` in `internal/sanitizer/sanitizer_test.go`. `TestIsOpenVPNStaticKey` in `patterns_test.go` covers the envelope detector.

- **Rule-ordering impact:** None. The `private_key` rule is distinct from `authserver_config` / `password` / `email` / `hostname` and does not participate in the §19.1 ordering invariants.

- **History:** SEC-H1 from the 2026-04-19 comprehensive review. Prior to the fix, `opnDossier sanitize` silently leaked raw HMAC keys sufficient to forge OpenVPN handshakes — the headline promise of the subcommand.

### 11.4 NetBird `setupKey` Is a Credential

The OPNsense `os-netbird` plugin persists the NetBird enrollment/setup key as `<setupKey>` under `<OPNsense><netbird><authentication>` (MVC model mounted at `//OPNsense/netbird/authentication`). The value is a UUID-format registration token. Because the sanitizer's bare `"key"` FieldPattern is exact-match only (see `exactMatchPatterns` — same trap as SNMPv3 `<enckey>`), compound names like `setupKey` leaked through `sanitize` in cleartext.

- **Symptom:** `sanitize` leaves NetBird setup keys readable in output. The key remains in `config.xml` when NetBird is disabled and often survives plugin removal as orphaned MVC XML, so disabled/removed plugins still leak.
- **Fix:** Add `"setupkey"`, `"setup_key"`, `"setup-key"` to the **`secret`** rule's `FieldPatterns` in `internal/sanitizer/rules.go` (enrollment token, not private-key material — unlike SNMPv3 `enckey` which lives on `private_key`) and to `passwordKeywords` in `internal/sanitizer/patterns.go`.
- **Detection:** `TestSanitizeXML_NetBirdSetupKey_RedactsSecret` + `TestSanitizeXML_NetBirdSetupKey_NoFalsePositives` in `internal/sanitizer/sanitizer_test.go`; `TestRedact_NetBirdSetupKey_RedactsSecret` in `rules_fieldpattern_test.go`.
- **Rule-ordering impact:** None. The `secret` rule already precedes `private_key` and does not participate in the §19.1 ordering invariants.
- **Upstream:** https://github.com/opnsense/plugins (`security/netbird`); field declared in `Authentication.xml` as `UpdateOnlyTextField` with UUID mask.
- **History:** Reported as a cleartext leak through `sanitize` when NetBird is disabled or the plugin XML remains after removal; fixed in #728.

## 12. Git Tagging

### 12.1 Tag the Squash-Merge Commit on Main

When tagging a release after a squash-merge PR, always tag the resulting commit **on `main`**, not the PR branch head. Squash-merge creates a new commit on `main` that is not an ancestor of the branch commits. If you tag the branch head instead, the tag points to an orphaned commit that `git log main` and `git describe` will never reach.

- **Symptom:** `git tag --merged main` does not list the release tag; `git describe` on `main` skips the version.
- **Fix:** `git checkout main && git pull && git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`
- **Prevention:** Always switch to `main` and pull before tagging. Never tag from the feature branch after merge.

## 13. Serialization Testing

### 13.1 Multiline Secret Assertions Against Serialized Output

`assert.NotContains(t, jsonStr, rawPEMKey)` is ineffective for multiline secrets: `encoding/json` escapes embedded newlines as `\n`, and `yaml.v3` may emit block scalars with indentation. The raw PEM substring will often not appear even when the secret is fully present in the output.

- **Symptom:** Test passes even when redaction is broken — the raw multiline string never matches the encoded form.
- **Fix:** Unmarshal JSON/YAML output back into a typed struct and assert on the parsed `PrivateKey` field values directly.
- **Precedent:** `certRedactionReport` in `internal/processor/report_ids_test.go`.

## 14. Sanitizer Rule Engine

### 14.1 `ShouldRedactField` Scans ALL Rules Globally

`ShouldRedactField` checks field names against `FieldPatterns` from **every** rule, not just the rule being tested. Adding a `FieldPattern` to any rule can break "should not match" test assertions for other rules.

- **Symptom:** A new field pattern causes unrelated sanitizer tests to fail.
- **Fix:** Check all rules' `FieldPatterns` when adding new patterns. Test assertions must account for global matching.

### 14.2 Value Detector Ordering

`ShouldRedactValue` checks field-name rules first (`ShouldRedactField`), then value-detector rules. Rules with both `FieldPatterns` and `ValueDetector`: a field match triggers redaction immediately; the value detector only runs on the value-only matching path.

### 14.3 Deterministic Mapper in Tests

A fresh `NewRuleEngine` creates a fresh `NewMapper()` — mappings are deterministic (e.g., first private IP maps to `10.0.0.1`, first hostname to `host-001.example.com`). Always assert exact expected values, not just inequality.

### 14.4 `SanitizeStruct` Skips Struct/Pointer-Valued Maps

`sanitizeReflect` in `internal/sanitizer/sanitizer.go` cannot recurse into `map[K]struct{...}` or `map[K]*struct{...}` values. Map values are not addressable in Go, so `reflect.Value.SetMapIndex` is the only way to write back — and that requires a fully reconstructed element, which the current walker does not perform. The guard at the top of the `reflect.Map` case detects this and logs a warning via the optional logger injected through `Sanitizer.SetLogger`. When no logger is set, the gap is silent.

- **Current scope:** This gap is reachable ONLY through `SanitizeStruct`, which is an opt-in consumer flow. The default `opnDossier sanitize` CLI uses `SanitizeXML` (raw element walk) and is not affected — element names like `<password>` and `<bcrypt-hash>` are still redacted regardless of the Go model shape.
- **Known current paths:** OPNsense `KeaDhcp4` already uses map-style subnet containers, but those maps hold config metadata, not credentials. No currently-shipped schema path puts a secret behind a struct-valued map.
- **Why warn instead of fix:** Supporting struct-valued maps via reflection requires reconstructing each element in place (read → recurse into a copy → `SetMapIndex` with the mutated copy). That work is scheduled under todo #151 (tag-based redaction) which will subsume this gap by annotating sensitive fields directly and driving redaction from tags instead of field-name heuristics. The warning is the bridge until #151 lands.
- **Regression tests:** `TestSanitizeStruct_MapStructValues_WarnsAndSkips` and `TestSanitizeStruct_MapStructValues_NilLoggerNoPanic` in `internal/sanitizer/sanitizer_reflect_test.go` pin both the warning path and the nil-logger nil-safety invariant. If a future enhancement starts handling struct-valued maps, those tests must be updated (or replaced) to reflect the new behavior — do not delete them blind.

## 15. Liberal Boolean and Integer Parsing

### 15.0 `BoolFlag` vs `FlexBool` vs `FlexInt` vs strict `int`/`bool`

Four boolean/int handling styles coexist in the schema layer — pick the right one.

| Type                  | Where defined                    | XML input semantics                                                                       | Use when                                                                                              |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `opnsense.BoolFlag`   | `pkg/schema/opnsense/common.go`  | absent → `false`; `<tag/>` → `true`; `<tag>body</tag>` → `shared.IsValueTrue(body)`       | Field is a boolean toggle in OPNsense/pfSense XML. Absence of the element is meaningful (= disabled). |
| `shared.FlexBool`     | `pkg/schema/shared/flex_bool.go` | body → `shared.IsValueTrue(body)`; no presence semantics                                  | Field is a boolean but the element is always emitted and presence carries no signal.                  |
| `shared.FlexInt`      | `pkg/schema/shared/flex_int.go`  | numeric → that value; `on`/`yes` → 1; `off`/`no` → 0; unknown non-numeric → wrapped error | Field must stay int-typed (may carry a count or a liberal toggle).                                    |
| strict `int` / `bool` | built-in                         | only decimal digits (for `int`); `true`/`false` only (for `bool`)                         | Field is genuinely numeric (UID, GID, PID, MTU) and non-numeric input is a real error.                |

Both OPNsense and pfSense emit the same liberal truthy vocabulary (`1|on|yes|true|enable|enabled`, case-insensitive). Always go through `shared.IsValueTrue` / `shared.IsValueFalse` — never hand-roll a truthy parser at the call site.

`BoolFlag.UnmarshalXML` was upgraded to delegate non-empty bodies through `shared.IsValueTrue` (previously it treated any element presence — even `<tag>0</tag>` — as `true`, silently dropping the body). Any code or test that relied on the old "presence = true regardless of body" behavior needs to be updated. See issue #558 and the plan at `docs/plans/2026-04-18-002-fix-issue-558-parser-on-value.md`.

### 15.1 Pointer-Receiver MarshalXML and Value Marshaling

`opnsense.BoolFlag` implements `MarshalXML` on a pointer receiver (`*BoolFlag`). When a struct containing a `BoolFlag` field is marshaled by value (not pointer), `encoding/xml` cannot find the pointer-receiver method and falls back to default `bool` serialization — producing `<enable>true</enable>` instead of `<enable/>`.

- **Symptom:** `BoolFlag` fields serialize as `true`/`false` text instead of presence-based empty elements.
- **Fix:** Add a private type alias (e.g., `type interfaceAlias Interface`) and a pointer-receiver `MarshalXML` on the parent struct that delegates via `e.EncodeElement((*alias)(ptr), start)`. Also pass `&value` (not `value`) when encoding the struct within map-based containers like `Interfaces.MarshalXML`.
- **Precedent:** `pkg/schema/pfsense/interfaces.go` — `interfaceAlias` and `(*Interface).MarshalXML`.
- **Rule:** Any pfSense struct forked from opnsense that changes a field to `BoolFlag` needs this pattern.
- **Scope:** The same pointer-receiver caveat applies to `shared.FlexBool` and `shared.FlexInt` — their `MarshalXML` methods are also pointer-receiver. Any struct embedding one of these types that is subsequently marshaled by value (not pointer) will silently fall back to Go's default `bool`/`int` serialization, producing `<tag>true</tag>` or `<tag>42</tag>` instead of the canonical form. Use the same alias + pointer-receiver `MarshalXML` workaround on the parent struct.

**See also:** [docs/solutions/runtime-errors/liberal-boolean-xml-parsing-opnsense-pfsense.md](docs/solutions/runtime-errors/liberal-boolean-xml-parsing-opnsense-pfsense.md) — full rollout of `BoolFlag`/`FlexBool`/`FlexInt` across OPNsense + pfSense schema, including the issue #558 `<tag>0</tag>` fix.

## 16. pfSense IPsec Enabled Flag

### 16.1 Phase 1 Is the Gate

`convertIPsec()` in `pkg/parser/pfsense/converter_services.go` sets `common.IPsecConfig.Enabled = true` **only when `len(ipsec.Phase1) > 0`**. Phase 2 tunnels and the mobile client configuration hang off Phase 1 in pfSense — without a Phase 1 entry they are functionally inactive, so the converter treats them as orphans: `Enabled` stays `false` and a medium-severity `ConversionWarning` is emitted for each orphan kind (`IPsec.Phase2`, `IPsec.Client`).

Downstream consumers (e.g., `builder_vpn.go`) short-circuit to "No IPsec configuration present" when `Enabled` is false — this is the correct behavior for orphan-only data, but breaks silently if the Phase 1 gate is ever weakened.

- **Symptom:** Valid Phase 1 tunnels show as "No IPsec configuration present" in reports (gate broken, `Enabled` stuck at `false`).
- **Detection:** `TestConverter_IPsecEnabled_Gotchas16` in `pkg/parser/pfsense/converter_ipsec_test.go` is the canonical regression. If that test fails, the gate has drifted.
- **Fix:** Keep the Phase 1 guard in `convertIPsec` intact. Phase 2 or mobile client without Phase 1 must stay orphan-warned, not implicitly promoted to `Enabled`.

## 17. HybridGenerator Interface Coupling

### 17.1 reportGenerator Must Stay Subset of ReportComposer

`hybrid_generator.go` defines `reportGenerator` — a narrow interface that `HybridGenerator` uses internally. `NewHybridGenerator` accepts `builder.ReportBuilder`, which embeds `ReportComposer`. The constructor stores the `ReportBuilder` value into a field typed as `reportGenerator`. If a method is added to `reportGenerator` without also adding it to `ReportComposer`, the `ReportBuilder` interface no longer satisfies `reportGenerator`, and the assignment in `NewHybridGenerator` fails at compile time. Note: there is no standalone `var _ reportGenerator = ...` assertion — the compile-time check occurs at the assignment site in the constructor.

- **Symptom:** `cannot use reportBuilder (variable of interface type builder.ReportBuilder) as reportGenerator value`
- **Fix:** Add the method to both `reportGenerator` (in `hybrid_generator.go`) and `ReportComposer` (in `builder/builder.go`).
- **Precedent:** `SetIncludeTunables` established this pattern; `SetFailuresOnly` was added following the same approach.

### 17.2 narrowOnlyBuilder Test Mock

`hybrid_generator_test.go` defines `narrowOnlyBuilder` — a minimal mock satisfying `reportGenerator` but NOT `ReportBuilder`. Adding a method to `reportGenerator` requires updating this mock.

- **Symptom:** `*narrowOnlyBuilder does not implement reportGenerator (missing method X)`
- **Fix:** Add a no-op method to `narrowOnlyBuilder` in `hybrid_generator_test.go`.

**See also:** [docs/solutions/logic-errors/documentation-code-drift-interface-refactoring.md](docs/solutions/logic-errors/documentation-code-drift-interface-refactoring.md) — the `ReportBuilder` → `SectionBuilder`/`TableWriter`/`ReportComposer` split that produced this coupling and its documentation-drift aftermath.

## 18. Kea DHCP4 Schema Version Pinning

### 18.1 Element Names Tied to MVC Model Version

The `KeaDhcp4` schema types in `pkg/schema/opnsense/kea.go` parse child elements named `subnet4` (under `<subnets>`) and `reservation` (under `<reservations>`), matching the OPNsense MVC model `KeaDhcpv4.xml` v1.0.4. If a future OPNsense release renames these elements, the Go XML decoder will silently produce empty slices — no error, no warning, just missing data.

- **Symptom:** Kea DHCP configured in OPNsense but opnDossier reports "no Kea subnets."
- **Detection:** Compare `KeaDhcp4.Version` attribute against known versions. If it differs from `1.0.4`, investigate element name changes.
- **Prevention:** When adding support for newer Kea MVC model versions, verify element names match by testing against a real config.xml from that version.

### 18.2 Pools Are Newline-Separated Inline Strings

Kea's `<pools>` element on each `<subnet4>` stores newline-separated (`\n`) IP range or CIDR strings via `KeaPoolsField` — NOT comma-separated UUIDs referencing a separate container. There is no `<pools>` container at the dhcp4 level.

- **Gotcha:** Only the first pool entry is represented in `DHCPScope.Range`. A conversion warning is emitted when multiple pools exist.
- **Source:** Confirmed via `KeaPoolsField.php` in OPNsense core.

### 18.3 Reservations Reference Subnets, Not Vice Versa

`KeaReservation.Subnet` contains the UUID of the parent subnet. The converter groups reservations by this field to attach them as static leases. Orphaned reservations (referencing nonexistent subnet UUIDs) emit a conversion warning.

- **Gotcha:** This is the inverse of what the OPNsense MVC model XML might suggest at first glance. The `<reservations>` container is a flat sibling of `<subnets>`, not nested inside each subnet.

## 19. Sanitizer Rule Ordering

### 19.1 `authserver_config` Must Precede `password` in `builtinRules()`

`ShouldRedactField` iterates the rule slice and returns on the first match. Both `authserver_config` and `password` match LDAP bind password fields — `authserver_config` via the exact pattern `authserver.ldap_bindpw`, and `password` via the `pass` substring. The `authserver_config` rule pseudonymizes the value through `MapAuthServerValue`; the `password` rule flat-redacts to `[REDACTED-PASSWORD]`.

- **Problem:** If `password` is moved above `authserver_config` in the `builtinRules()` slice, `ldap_bindpw` values silently switch from pseudonymized to flat-redacted. No error or warning is emitted.
- **Symptom:** Sanitized output shows `[REDACTED-PASSWORD]` for LDAP bind passwords instead of a pseudonymized value like `ldap-bindpw-001`.
- **Fix:** Ensure `authserver_config` remains the first rule in `builtinRules()`. The same first-match precedence applies to `email` vs `hostname` (email must precede hostname).

## 20. pfSense Validator Injection

### 20.1 `SetValidator` Is Guarded by `sync.Once`

`pkg/parser/pfsense.SetValidator` installs the semantic validator used by `Parser.ParseAndValidate`. The slot is unexported (`validateFuncHolder atomic.Pointer[...]`) and is written exactly once per process — the first `SetValidator` call wins, every subsequent call is silently dropped. The `atomic.Pointer` pairs with `sync.Once` so the writer side synchronizes cleanly with the concurrent reader side in `ParseAndValidate`.

The one-shot lock is the enforcement point against a dynamically loaded compliance plugin's `init()` reassigning the validator after CLI setup. Because `plugin.Open` fires the loaded `.so`'s `init()` at load time — later than Go's own `init()` ordering for in-tree packages — `cmd/root.go:init` calls `SetValidator` first, commits the sync.Once, and any subsequent plugin `init()` is effectively locked out. See the comprehensive-review ticket SEC-H2 / todos #105 and #128 for the original finding.

- **Gotcha:** Do NOT reintroduce a public mutable `ValidateFunc` variable. Any value that is directly assignable from plugin code re-opens the stomp hazard. The injection point MUST go through `SetValidator`.
- **Gotcha:** Test code that needs to swap validators across subtests uses the `ResetValidatorForTesting` / `ValidatorForTesting` helpers defined in `pkg/parser/pfsense/export_test.go`. These live in `_test.go` and therefore are NOT part of the public API — never promote them to a plain `.go` file.
- **Gotcha:** The exported `SetValidator` is safe to call from any goroutine; concurrent writers race to win the `sync.Once`, but only one does. Readers never see a torn value because the holder is `atomic.Pointer[...]` — verified by `TestPfSense_SetValidator_Race` under `-race`.
- **Regression tests:** `TestPfSense_SetValidator_CannotBeOverwritten` pins the stomp-protection invariant; `TestPfSense_SetValidator_Race` pins the concurrent-writer safety. Both live in `pkg/parser/pfsense/parser_test.go`. If either fails, the §20 defense has regressed.

## 21. CoreProcessor Concurrency

### 21.1 Stateless-Per-Call Invariant

`internal/processor.CoreProcessor` is stateless per call. `logger` is set once in `NewCoreProcessor` and is never reassigned. `validateFn` is set once in `NewCoreProcessor` and is never reassigned by any production code path; in-package tests inject panicking validators or test doubles directly via the unexported field (see `validate_test.go`'s `processor.validateFn = func(...) { panic(...) }` pattern), which is safe because each test constructs its own `*CoreProcessor`. Every per-call value (`config`, `normalizedCfg`, `validationErrors`, `report`) is local-scope. The `sync.Mutex` that previously guarded `Process()` was removed in NATS-35 because it protected no shared mutable state and serialized concurrent calls unnecessarily — a single shared `*CoreProcessor` is now safe to share across goroutines and `Process` calls run in parallel.

- **Symptom of regression:** A future contributor adds a mutable field to `CoreProcessor` (e.g., a cache, counter, hot-reloaded config, or per-instance result accumulator). `go test -race ./internal/processor/...` flags a data race in `TestCoreProcessor_RaceConditions` or `TestCoreProcessor_ConcurrentSafety`.
- **Fix:** Either remove the new field, scope it per-call (return it instead of storing on the receiver), or reinstate explicit synchronization with a comment naming exactly what shared state is being protected.
- **Prevention:** Treat `CoreProcessor` like the converter packages — receivers carry construction-time configuration only; per-call state lives in locals. The struct doc comment in `internal/processor/processor.go` names the invariant and the caller contract; do not weaken either without re-evaluating thread safety. If you find yourself wanting a public `SetValidatorForTesting` helper to make the in-package field write more discoverable, mirror the §20.1 `pfsense.SetValidator`/`ResetValidatorForTesting` pattern with `export_test.go` exposure rather than promoting the field to public.

### 21.2 Caller Must Not Mutate `*CommonDevice` Concurrently With `Process()`

`Process()` calls `normalize()` which performs a shallow struct copy of `*cfg` and then `slices.Clone`s a specific set of fields. Two clone categories — both intentional, both at `internal/processor/normalize.go:18-37`:

- **Mutated by normalize phases (cloned for correctness):** `FirewallRules`, `Users`, `Groups`, `Sysctl`, `LoadBalancer.MonitorTypes`. Sorted and/or rewritten by `sortSlices`/`canonicalizeAddresses`.
- **Defensively cloned to isolate credential-bearing data from the caller:** `Certificates`, `DHCP` (with deep `AdvancedV4`/`AdvancedV6` pointer copies), `VPN.WireGuard.Clients`. Not mutated by normalize, but downstream code must not accidentally leak edits back to the caller's struct.

All other slices on the input (`Interfaces`, `VLANs`, `Bridges`, `CAs`, etc.) share their backing arrays with the caller's `*CommonDevice` for the duration of the call, and `report.NormalizedConfig` continues to share those backing arrays after the call returns.

- **Gotcha:** If a caller mutates one of those still-aliased slices on the input `*CommonDevice` while `Process()` is running, or while another consumer is reading the same field on `report.NormalizedConfig`, there is a data race that `-race` will catch. The removed §21.1 mutex never protected against this — it was a per-`CoreProcessor` lock, not a per-`*CommonDevice` lock. The cloned categories above are safe regardless of caller behavior.
- **Caller contract:** Pass a fresh or fully-quiesced `*CommonDevice` per call. Do not mutate it concurrently with any in-flight `Process()` and do not mutate it post-call while a downstream consumer is still reading `report.NormalizedConfig`.
- **Adding new cloned fields:** When a downstream consumer or a new analyzer would observe writes to a still-aliased field, add it to the defensive-clone list in `normalize.go` and update this section. Do not silently start writing to a previously-aliased field.

### 21.3 `Report.mu` and `WorkerPool.closedMu` Are Out of Scope for §21.1

§21.1 explicitly removed only the `CoreProcessor.mu` field. Two other mutexes in `internal/processor/` guard real shared state and must remain:

- **`Report.mu sync.RWMutex`** (`internal/processor/report.go`) — protects `Findings` against concurrent mutation. The `analyze` pipeline itself is sequential today (no goroutines), so the lock currently functions as forward-looking insurance: it keeps `AddFinding` (write) safe against concurrent reads from `ToJSON`/`ToYAML`/`TotalFindings` (`RLock` paths) when a single `*Report` is shared across goroutines, and it preserves correctness if a future analyzer fans out to sub-goroutines that each call `AddFinding`. Removing it would re-open both windows.
- **`WorkerPool.closedMu sync.RWMutex`** (`internal/processor/concurrent.go`) — channel-close guard in the worker pool used by `ProcessBatch`. Concrete: prevents a `send on closed channel` panic when one goroutine calls `Close()` while another is mid-`Submit`.

Do not remove either of these in a "clean up the package's locks" sweep. They protect distinct invariants from the one §21.1 addressed.

## 22. Documentation Tooling

### 22.1 mdformat Collapses Consecutive `**Label**:` Lines

With `wrap = "no"` in `.mdformat.toml`, mdformat joins consecutive `**Label**:` lines onto a SINGLE line. ADR frontmatter written as three lines —

```markdown
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Status**: accepted
**Deciders**: ...
```

— renders after the pre-commit hook as one line: `**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD **Status**: accepted **Deciders**: ...`. That collapsed form is canonical.

- **Gotcha:** Do not "fix" these back onto separate lines — the `mdformat` pre-commit hook re-collapses them and the edit will not survive a commit. Both `docs/adr/template.md` and the ADRs are kept in the collapsed form, so they are already mutually consistent.
- **Gotcha:** Reviewers (e.g. CodeRabbit) sometimes flag the collapsed frontmatter as a layout defect and suggest splitting the lines. That suggestion is a false positive against this repo's formatter — decline it.

### 22.2 mdformat Excludes Live in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, Not `.mdformat.toml`

File exclusions for the `mdformat` hook are the pre-commit hook's native `exclude:` regex in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (currently `*.golden.md`, `docs/cli/`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `*.tpl.md`). Do NOT reintroduce an `exclude = [...]` list in `.mdformat.toml`: that feature requires the hook to run under Python 3.13+, but pre-commit builds the hook venv with its own interpreter (3.11 today), so it fails on every markdown file with `'exclude' patterns are only available on Python 3.13+`.
