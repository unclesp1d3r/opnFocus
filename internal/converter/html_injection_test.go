// incident-response capture, or a backup of unknown provenance, and the whole
// point of the tool is to turn it into a report someone then opens. Before the
// fix, values such as the hostname were concatenated into markdown unescaped
// and the HTML renderer was configured to pass raw HTML through, so a payload
// in config.xml became live markup in report.html.
//
// The test asserts the outcome rather than the mechanism, so it keeps working
// if the escaping moves: no dangerous construct survives into the HTML, and the
// value is still visible in escaped form so the fix cannot be mistaken for
