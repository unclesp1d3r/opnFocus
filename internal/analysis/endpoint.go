//   - the empty string, produced by an omitted or empty <source>/<destination>
//     element; a rule with no source matches every source
//   - the wildcard CIDRs 0.0.0.0/0 and ::/0
//
// Comparing against the "any" literal alone classifies the other three as a
// specific host, so a pass rule matching all traffic reads as scoped and the
// checks that exist to catch exactly that rule report compliant.

// This tests an address spelling only. Callers holding a common.RuleEndpoint
// want IsAnyEndpoint, which also accounts for an inverted match. It is deliberately not used by the overlap engine in

// complement of what its address names. A negated wildcard therefore matches
// nothing at all, so classifying it by address alone turns a rule that passes
// no traffic into a highest-severity wide-open finding.
//
// Negated inverts the address only. The vendor schema carries <not> beside the
// address fields and pfSense presents it as an invert-match toggle on the
// address, so port and protocol predicates are unaffected by it.

// through this keeps the audit path consistent with them rather than letting
