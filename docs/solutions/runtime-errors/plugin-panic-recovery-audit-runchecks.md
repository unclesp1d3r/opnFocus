# Panic Recovery Around Plugin RunChecks() Calls

## Problem

`PluginRegistry.RunComplianceChecks` in `internal/audit/plugin.go` called `p.RunChecks(device)` without any panic protection. The `compliance.Plugin` interface allows arbitrary implementations, including dynamically-loaded `.so` plugins. Any panic in `RunChecks()` propagated uncaught through the audit pipeline, killing the process and losing all other plugins' results.

**Symptoms:** If any compliance plugin panicked during `RunChecks()`, the entire audit crashed. Other healthy plugins' results were lost. No structured error reporting for the failure.

## Root Cause

The compliance plugin interface (`compliance.Plugin`) is an extension point designed for both built-in and dynamically-loaded plugins. Dynamic plugins loaded via Go's `plugin` package can contain arbitrary code. A bare `p.RunChecks(device)` call provides no isolation boundary, so any panic in plugin code propagates up the call stack and terminates the audit.

## Solution

Wrap the `p.RunChecks(device)` call in an immediately-invoked function with `defer recover()`. Add a `*logging.Logger` parameter to `RunComplianceChecks` for structured panic logging.

### Code Example

```go
// Before: bare call, panic propagates and kills the process
findings := p.RunChecks(device)

// After: panic recovery with structured logging and stack trace
var findings []compliance.Finding

func() {
    defer func() {
        if r := recover(); r != nil {
            logger.Error("plugin panicked during RunChecks",
                "plugin", pluginName,
                "panic", r,
                "stack", string(debug.Stack()),
            )
        }
    }()
    findings = p.RunChecks(device)
}()
```

The immediately-invoked function literal creates a deferred recovery scope isolated to the single plugin call. If `RunChecks` panics, the deferred function catches it, logs the plugin name and panic value, and execution continues with `findings` at its zero value (nil slice). The surrounding loop proceeds to process remaining plugins unaffected.

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Logger parameter uses `*logging.Logger`** -- matches the project's charmbracelet/log-based logging, ensuring panic recovery logs respect the application's configured output format, level, and destination. A nil guard defaults to a fallback logger so callers can never trigger a secondary panic on the recovery path.
2. **Stack trace included via `runtime/debug.Stack()`** -- giving actionable debugging information for misbehaving plugins (especially dynamic `.so` files).
3. **Panicked plugins retained in results with safe defaults** -- a `panicked` flag gates the post-recovery path. When set, safe defaults (`pluginName`, `Version: "unknown (panicked)"`, empty compliance map) are populated and the loop `continue`s, skipping method calls (`Name()`, `Description()`, `GetControls()`) on the potentially corrupt plugin. Downstream consumers can see the plugin was requested and evaluated. See GOTCHAS.md SS2.2.
4. **Post-recovery method calls avoided** -- after a panic, the plugin's internal state may be corrupt. Calling `p.Name()`, `p.GetControls()`, etc. could trigger a secondary unrecovered panic. The recovery path uses only the `pluginName` string already in scope from the loop variable.

### Files Changed

- `internal/audit/plugin.go` -- core panic recovery wrapper with `*logging.Logger` and `debug.Stack()`
- `internal/audit/plugin_manager.go` -- passes `pm.logger` (configured logger)
- `internal/audit/mode_controller.go` -- passes `mc.logger` (configured logger)
- `internal/audit/plugin_global_test.go` -- `mockPanickingPlugin` and isolation tests added
- `internal/audit/mode_controller_test.go` -- call sites updated, `LoadDynamicPlugins` test enabled

## Prevention

### Pattern

When calling any method on an interface implementation that may originate from external or dynamic sources (plugin `.so` files, user-provided implementations), wrap the call in a deferred `recover()` that captures the panic value and logs it. The recovery boundary should be as narrow as possible -- one per plugin invocation, not one global recovery around the entire audit loop.

### Where Else This Might Apply

| Call site                            | Method                                   | Status                                                       |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `RunComplianceChecks`                | `plugin.RunChecks()`                     | Protected (this fix)                                         |
| `InitializePlugins`                  | `plugin.Name()`, `plugin.Version()`      | Review needed -- dynamic plugin metadata accessors can panic |
| `LoadDynamicPlugins`                 | `plugin.Lookup("Plugin")` result casting | Review needed -- type assertion on `plugin.Symbol` can panic |
| `GetControls()` / `GetControlByID()` | Called in `deriveSeverityFromControl`    | Review needed -- called during severity derivation           |

### Testing Strategy

Use the `mockPanickingPlugin` pattern:

1. Embed `mockCompliancePlugin`, override `RunChecks` to panic
2. Table-driven tests with both panicking and healthy plugins
3. Assert: healthy findings preserved, panicked plugin present with zero findings, no error returned
4. Run `just test-race` to confirm no data races in recovery closures

### Review Checklist

- [ ] Plugin interface method calls on dynamic/external plugins are wrapped in `defer recover()`
- [ ] Recovery boundary is per-plugin, not per-audit-run
- [ ] Panicked plugins retained in results (not skipped) per GOTCHAS.md SS2.2
- [ ] Tests include `mockPanickingPlugin` scenarios alongside healthy plugins
- [ ] `just test-race` passes
