# Security Scoring Methodology

## Overview

The opnDossier security assessment functions provide a standardized approach to evaluating OPNsense configuration security posture. This document explains the risk label mapping and security scoring methodology implemented in the `MarkdownBuilder` security functions.

## Risk Label Mapping

The security assessment uses consistent emoji + text risk labels across all output formats:

| Severity | Label | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `critical` | 🔴 Critical Risk | Immediate attention required |
| `high` | 🟠 High Risk | High priority security concern |
| `medium` | 🟡 Medium Risk | Moderate security concern |
| `low` | 🟢 Low Risk | Low priority security issue |
| `info` / `informational` | ℹ️ Informational | Informational finding |
| Unknown/Invalid | ⚪ Unknown Risk | Unrecognized severity level |

### Usage in Reports

Risk labels are used consistently across:
- Template-based markdown generation (`getRiskLevel` function)
- Programmatic markdown generation (`AssessRiskLevel` method)
- Service risk assessment (`AssessServiceRisk` method)

## Service Risk Assessment

The `AssessServiceRisk()` method maps common services to risk levels based on security implications:

### Critical Risk Services
- **Telnet**: Unencrypted remote access protocol

### High Risk Services
- **FTP**: Unencrypted file transfer protocol
- **VNC**: Remote desktop with potential security vulnerabilities

### Medium Risk Services
- **RDP**: Remote desktop protocol with authentication risks

### Low Risk Services
- **SSH**: Secure shell with proper authentication

### Informational Services
- **HTTPS**: Secure web services
- **Unknown/Custom**: Services not in the risk database

## Security Scoring Algorithm

The `CalculateSecurityScore()` method provides a 0-100 security score based on configuration analysis.

### Base Score: 100 points

### Penalty System

| Security Issue | Penalty Points | Description |
|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| No Firewall Rules | -20 | Missing basic firewall protection |
| Management on WAN | -30 | Administrative services exposed to untrusted networks |
| Insecure Sysctl Settings | -5 each | Per misconfigured system tunable |
| Default User Accounts | -15 each | Per default system account (admin, root, user) |

### Sysctl Security Checks

The following system tunables are evaluated for security compliance:

| Tunable | Expected Value | Security Impact |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| `net.inet.ip.forwarding` | `0` | Prevents IP forwarding unless explicitly needed |
| `net.inet6.ip6.forwarding` | `0` | Prevents IPv6 forwarding unless explicitly needed |
| `net.inet.tcp.blackhole` | `2` | Drops TCP packets to closed ports silently |
| `net.inet.udp.blackhole` | `1` | Drops UDP packets to closed ports silently |

### Management Port Detection

The following ports are considered management ports when exposed on WAN:
- **22** (SSH)
- **80** (HTTP)
- **443** (HTTPS)
- **8080** (Alternative HTTP)

## Implementation Notes

### Conservative Heuristics
- Scoring uses conservative heuristics designed for audit readability
- Penalties are intentionally conservative to avoid false positives
- Score is clamped between 0-100 to ensure consistent ranges

### Single Source of Truth
The current implementation provides a transparent wrapper while existing scoring logic is consolidated. Future updates will centralize scoring logic to ensure consistency across the model, processor, and converter layers.

### Offline Operation
All security assessment functions operate completely offline with no external dependencies, making them suitable for airgapped environments.

## Usage Examples

### Risk Level Assessment
```go
builder := NewMarkdownBuilder()
risk := builder.AssessRiskLevel("high")
// Returns: "🟠 High Risk"
```

### Service Risk Assessment
```go
service := model.Service{Name: "SSH Daemon"}
risk := builder.AssessServiceRisk(service)
// Returns: "🟢 Low Risk"
```

### Security Score Calculation
```go
score := builder.CalculateSecurityScore(opnSenseDocument)
// Returns: 0-100 integer score
```

## Integration with Reports

### Blue Team Reports
- Focus on clarity, grouping, and actionability
- Include compliance matrices and remediation guidance
- Highlight security features and vulnerabilities

### Red Team Reports
- Focus on target prioritization and pivot surface discovery
- Emphasize attack vectors and exposure points
- Highlight management interfaces and weak configurations

### Standard Reports
- Balanced view of configuration security posture
- Include both security strengths and areas for improvement
- Provide clear recommendations for security hardening

## Future Enhancements

1. **Centralized Scoring**: Consolidate scoring logic across model, processor, and converter layers
2. **Configurable Weights**: Allow customization of penalty weights for different environments
3. **Extended Service Database**: Expand service risk mappings for additional protocols
4. **Compliance Integration**: Integrate with STIG, SANS, and other compliance frameworks
5. **Dynamic Risk Assessment**: Incorporate threat intelligence and configuration context
