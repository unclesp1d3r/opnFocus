# Getting Started with opnDossier

By the end of this tutorial, you will have installed opnDossier and generated your first configuration report.

## Prerequisites

- An OPNsense `config.xml` file (exported from your firewall via **System > Configuration > Backups**)

## 1. Install opnDossier

Pick the method that fits your platform:

**macOS (Homebrew):**

```bash
brew install EvilBit-Labs/tap/opndossier
```

**Go (any platform with Go 1.26+):**

```bash
go install github.com/EvilBit-Labs/opnDossier@latest
```

!!! warning "`go install` names the binary `opnDossier`"
    `go install` takes the binary name from the module path, so it installs `opnDossier` (capital D), not `opndossier`. On Linux and other case-sensitive filesystems the commands in this guide will not resolve until you rename it:

    ```bash
    mv -i "$(go env GOPATH)/bin/opnDossier" "$(go env GOPATH)/bin/opndossier"
    ```

    Homebrew and the release archives install `opndossier` directly and need no rename.

**Linux packages, Docker, and pre-built binaries** are also available -- see the [Installation Guide](installation.md) for all options.

**Expected result:** the `opndossier` command is now available in your shell.

## 2. Verify the Installation

```bash
opndossier version
```

**Expected result:** a version line such as `opndossier version 1.7.2`.

If you see `command not found`, check two things: that the Go bin directory (typically `$HOME/go/bin`) is on your `PATH`, and — if you installed via `go install` — that you renamed the binary as described above. `ls "$(go env GOPATH)/bin" | grep -i opndossier` shows which name you actually have.

## 3. Convert a Config to Markdown

Generate a Markdown report from your OPNsense configuration:

```bash
opndossier convert config.xml
```

**Expected result:** Markdown output printed to your terminal, including sections for interfaces, firewall rules, VPN tunnels, and other configured services.

## 4. Save the Report to a File

Write the report directly to a file instead of stdout:

```bash
opndossier convert config.xml -o report.md
```

**Expected result:** opnDossier writes the report without any terminal output. Open `report.md` in any Markdown viewer to browse the full report.

## 5. View in the Terminal

Display the configuration with terminal styling and syntax highlighting:

```bash
opndossier display config.xml
```

**Expected result:** a styled, color-highlighted overview of your configuration rendered directly in the terminal.

## 6. Validate a Config

Check your configuration for structural issues:

```bash
opndossier validate config.xml
```

**Expected result:** a validation summary. If the configuration is well-formed, you will see a message confirming validation passed.
