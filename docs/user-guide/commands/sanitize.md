# sanitize

The `sanitize` command redacts sensitive information from an OPNsense or pfSense configuration file while preserving its structure and relationships. The output is a valid XML file with passwords, keys, IP addresses, `system/authserver` LDAP values, and other secrets replaced by consistent pseudonymized values -- so network topology and rule logic remain visible without exposing real credentials or addresses. Both OPNsense password fields (`<password>`) and pfSense bcrypt hashes (`<bcrypt-hash>`) are detected and redacted.

**When to use it:**

- Sharing configs with vendors, consultants, or support teams without exposing secrets
- Posting config excerpts in public forums or bug reports
- Creating sanitized test fixtures from production configs
- Compliance workflows that require redaction before archival or review

## Usage

```text
opndossier sanitize [flags] <config.xml>
```

## Flags

| Flag        | Short | Default    | Description                                            |
| ----------- | ----- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--mode`    | `-m`  | `moderate` | Sanitization mode: `aggressive`, `moderate`, `minimal` |
| `--output`  | `-o`  | stdout     | Output file path                                       |
| `--mapping` |       |            | Save a mapping file for reverse lookup (JSON)          |
| `--force`   |       | `false`    | Overwrite existing output file without prompt          |

For global flags (`--verbose`, `--quiet`, `--config`, etc.), see [Configuration Reference](../configuration-reference.md).

## Sanitization Modes

The `--mode` flag controls how aggressively the sanitizer redacts data. Each mode builds on the previous one -- `aggressive` redacts everything `moderate` does, plus more.

### Minimal

Redacts direct secrets and pseudonymizes sensitive `system/authserver` LDAP values. Use this in trusted environments where most network topology can remain visible but credentials and LDAP server details must not.

- Passwords, passphrases
- API keys, tokens, secrets
- Pre-shared keys (IPsec, WireGuard)
- Private keys
- SSH authorized keys
- SNMP community strings
- Sensitive `system/authserver` LDAP values
- Plugin enrollment credentials when present in raw XML (for example OPNsense NetBird `<setupKey>`)

### Moderate (default)

Adds network identity redaction on top of minimal. Use this for sharing with internal teams or contractors who should not see external-facing addresses.

Everything in minimal, plus:

- Public IP addresses (mapped to consistent pseudonyms)
- MAC addresses
- Email addresses

Private IPs (RFC 1918) and hostnames outside `system/authserver` are preserved, so internal network structure remains readable.

### Aggressive

Redacts everything for maximum safety. Use this before posting configs publicly or sharing with untrusted parties.

Everything in moderate, plus:

- Private IP addresses
- Hostnames and FQDNs
- Usernames (except system accounts like `root`, `admin`, `nobody`)
- Certificates
- Subnet/CIDR values
- VPN/tunnel endpoint addresses
- Cloud provider identifiers (account IDs, zone IDs)
- Public keys

### Referential Integrity

Across all modes, the sanitizer maintains referential integrity -- the same original value always maps to the same replacement value throughout the entire file. If `192.168.1.1` becomes `10.0.0.1`, every occurrence of `192.168.1.1` in the config is replaced with `10.0.0.1`. This means firewall rules, routing tables, and DHCP scopes remain internally consistent and logically readable.

## Mapping File

The `--mapping` flag saves a JSON file that records every substitution the sanitizer made. This serves as a lookup table so you can trace a redacted value back to its original -- for example, when a colleague asks "what is `198.51.100.1` in the sanitized config?" you can look it up in the mapping file.

```bash
opndossier sanitize config.xml -o sanitized.xml --mapping mappings.json
```

The mapping file is organized by category:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "timestamp": "2026-03-12T10:30:00Z",
  "mode": "aggressive",
  "mappings": {
    "ip_addresses": {
      "203.0.113.50": "198.51.100.1",
      "203.0.113.51": "198.51.100.2",
      "192.168.1.1": "10.0.0.1"
    },
    "hostnames": {
      "fw01.example.com": "host-001.example.com"
    },
    "usernames": {
      "jdoe": "user-001"
    },
    "domains": {
      "example.com": "domain-001.example.com"
    },
    "mac_addresses": {
      "aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff": "00:00:5e:00:53:01"
    },
    "emails": {
      "admin@example.com": "user-001@example.com"
    },
    "authserver": {
      "name": {
        "corp-ldap": "authserver-001"
      },
      "host": {
        "ldap.corp.example.com": "ldap-001.example.invalid"
      },
      "ldap_port": {
        "636": "55001"
      },
      "ldap_bindpw": {
        "supersecret123": "BindPw-001-NotReal!"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

There is no built-in command to reverse a sanitization using the mapping file -- it is a reference for manual lookup. Keep the mapping file secure and do not share it alongside the sanitized config, as it contains the original values.

## Sanitize vs Redact

opnDossier offers two ways to hide sensitive data:

|               | `sanitize` command                                    | `convert --redact`                                          |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Output**    | Valid OPNsense XML                                    | Markdown, JSON, YAML, etc.                                  |
| **Scope**     | Full config file with consistent pseudonyms           | Report fields replaced with `[REDACTED]`                    |
| **Traceable** | Yes, via mapping file (manual lookup)                 | No                                                          |
| **Use case**  | Sharing a config file that others can load or analyze | Sharing a report where values do not need to be traced back |

## Examples

```bash
# Sanitize for public sharing (maximum redaction)
opndossier sanitize config.xml --mode aggressive -o config-sanitized.xml

# Sanitize with default moderate mode
opndossier sanitize config.xml -o sanitized.xml

# Save a mapping file for reverse lookup
opndossier sanitize config.xml -o sanitized.xml --mapping mappings.json

# Overwrite an existing output file without prompting
opndossier sanitize config.xml -o sanitized.xml --force
```
